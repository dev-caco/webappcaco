This is a website to promote and provide information about the SMS ChatBot CaCo. It gives a brief introduction about the products features, and includes a video demonstrating of CaCo being used.

There is also a sign up page, where new users can input their email and phone number information.  Becuase this product was designed for use on the Queen's Campus, only users that have a registered Queen's email can be verified for usage.
Only users who verify themselves through this page will get access to the SMS assistant.
